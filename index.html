        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Jovany Cardenas Vargas. I come from a family of two younger brothers and two older half-brothers. My parents are from Mexico and work in the strawberry fields. I was born and raised in Santa Maria, CA, and developed an interest in Computer Science during high school, starting with a Web Design class that sparked my passion for coding.</p>
        <p>I graduated from Pioneer Valley High School in 2022 with a 3.6 GPA and continued my education at Allan Hancock College, where I am pursuing an Associate's in Science for Computer Science. My coursework includes CS111, CS112, CS131, and I am currently taking CS161. I plan to transfer to a four-year university like CalPoly SLO to further my education.</p>
        <p>Outside of my academic pursuits, I am involved in various extracurricular activities, including SkillsUSA, the Computer Science Club, the Science and Engineering Club, and support programs like EOPS, CAN-TRIO, and MESA. I have achieved significant success in SkillsUSA, winning gold at the state level for two years and silver at the national level. I am competing again this year and have already won gold at the state level.</p>
        <p>In addition to being a full-time student, I work at the Career Center at Allan Hancock College as a student worker, assisting students with job searches, resume creation, typing tests, and meeting with career counselors. I also help organize events like Career Expo and Career Carnival, and support various programs within the Career Center, including SkillsUSA and College Corps.</p>

            <li><strong>15x15 Grid Game</strong> (2022-23 Nationals): Developed a GUI-based game similar to Minesweeper, featuring a 15x15 grid with hidden bombs and a health system to avoid the bombs.</li>
            <li><strong>Escape Velocity Calculator</strong> (2023-24 Regionals): Created a program to calculate the velocity needed to escape Earth's orbit using the radius and altitude.</li>
            <li><strong>Log File Creator</strong> (2023-24 Regionals): Developed a program to save provided information as a log file.</li>
            <li><strong>Crafting Inventory System</strong> (2023-24 Regionals): Built a crafting inventory system where recipes can be made from available items.</li>
            <li><strong>Range Interpreter</strong> (2023-24 State): Built a function to interpret a string of comma and/or hyphen-separated range descriptions into an ordered array of integers, handling various edge cases and invalid data.</li>
            <li><strong>File Search Tool</strong> (2023-24 State): Created a program to search for filenames within a directory structure based on user input, including features for constrained search depth, infinite loop prevention, and a user-friendly interface for viewing file contents.</li>
